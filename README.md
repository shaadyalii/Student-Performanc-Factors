# Brief
Student performance is influenced by various factors such as study habits, parental support, sleep, extracurricular activities, and socioeconomic conditions.
Understanding these factors helps identify students at risk and allows for personalized interventions.
In this project, we use Machine Learning (Linear Regression & other models) to predict exam scores from given features, clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and evaluate model performance.


# DataSet

The dataset used in this project is[StudentPerformanceFactors data set] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors?resource=download&select=StudentPerformanceFactors.csv) from Kaggle . This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of various factors affecting student performance in exams. It includes information on study habits, attendance, parental involvement, and other aspects influencing academic success
